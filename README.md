##  Code Example
Lights and their adjacent neighbors:

```python
def toggle_light(lights, row, col, grid_size):
    lights[row][col] = 1 - lights[row][col]
    if row > 0:
        lights[row - 1][col] = 1 - lights[row - 1][col]
    if row < grid_size - 1:
        lights[row + 1][col] = 1 - lights[row + 1][col]
    if col > 0:
        lights[row][col - 1] = 1 - lights[row][col - 1]
    if col < grid_size - 1:
        lights[row][col + 1] = 1 - lights[row][col + 1]
```
This function ensures that clicking on one light affects its surrounding neighbors.
